# Function Specification

## 1.Overview

We are building an application which provides a basic questionnaire for any topics.
Customer can type his own questions and the application will show it for the users.
Users can register to this site, and they have to fill a survey first to assess their knowledge. Then
they can fill the actual questionnaire about any topics.
This application will be a web application with a realtime database, and it's written on PHP langugage.
This PHP application read the questions from an CSV file.
There are two types of questions.
1. Survey questions
2. Topic questions

Survey questions are about the topic questions, but these questions more like an exam, users has to fill it, before they
can fill the real questionnaire.
This survey has less questions then the real questionnaire.
Topic questions are about the actual topic questions.

So, there is no pre-defined questions, the customer will add questions or delete them.

There is no need an administrative interface for upload questions, and uneccessary to save questions in database, even so the results of questionnaire.
Results are for users personally.
